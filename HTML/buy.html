<h2> Great Greens Every Time </h2>
<p> You can have the benefits of fresh greens and herbs all year long with the cloud house. Cloud House is the first table top greenhouse that comes with a green thumb already built-in and ready to use. No worries, no failures, only great taste and healthy eating all year long. </p>
<h2> Low Cost Sensors + Internet Cloud = Great Results </h2>
<p id="special"> The cloud House table top greenhouse combines low cost modern enviornmental sensors with the power of the Internet to connect the greenhouse to a data warehouse, analytical engine, and control system to ensure the best results for each plant every time. </p>
<p> Your Cloud House automatically obtains real-time data from your Cloud House Table Top Greenhouse (SMART House) and sends it to the Cloud House web site. At the web site your data is combined with data from other users and expert botanists to determine the right operating parameters for your location. Then the Cloud House Analytical Engine and Controller automatically takes care of temperature control, lighting, and watering. You only have to periodically harvest and make a fantastic meal with your homegrown greens. </p>
